This project uses the API tool DGiDB for to determine potential gene and drug
interactions for hypertension.
 
Following this analysis from the database, RNA-seq data was obtained from
NCBI GEO to analyze the differential expression of hypertension and resistant
hypertension patients. In addition, DGiDB was integrated to determine
any key interactions that can offer as a viable treatment option.
